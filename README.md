# Accounting
This app pulls email notifications from my email inbox regarding new bank transactions and transfers the relevant info to a Google Sheet via their service account API for partially automated budgeting. It runs on an hourly basis through Cron.

# Requirements
Need to set up a service account with Google API to carry out OAuth2.0 for calling the Google Sheets API.
See https://developers.google.com/api-client-library/python/auth/service-accounts for details.
